#THIS IS MY README

This page was created as a baseline for my portfolio for my future work as a programmer/webdesigner.
This page is a work in progress. Flex has been applied but does not seem effective. As my understanding of CSS and Flex grows I will be updating this page so it displays correctly on different screens.
This project allowed me to get creative with colour and style within CSS, as well as expressing myself and discovering that I would like my style to be far more sophisticated than what I have created within this website. 
I created a navigation bar that sends the user to the "About Me", "Projects" and "contact" sections on the page. 
Within the "Projects" section I provided images of previous work with links to those pages. 
The contact section needs work, the links work but they are not dynamic and do not stand out well.
