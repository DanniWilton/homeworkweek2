              Hello World!<br>
              <br>
              My name is Dannielle (Danni) Wilton and this page was designed and launched by me!<br>
              <br>
              I have a degree in Psychology and Addiction studies which led me to my previous role as a Recovery Support Worker in Mental Health. Due to an incident out in the field, I took some time off from working and focused on my passion for dance, performance and costume creation. During this time I realised I wanted to explore my creative side on a more professional level. With lockdown impacting everyone, technology and the world wide web being the number 1 way to communicate, I decided to start a new chapter in coding.<br>
              I am brand new to the world of coding and web design. I am currently enrolled in Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Western Australia. While it has been a challenge, I have been able to exercise my creative side along with the problem solving skills I obtained in my degree and career prior.<br>
              I run the social media for my cabaret troupe and look forward to applying my new skills towards enhancing our social media presence.
